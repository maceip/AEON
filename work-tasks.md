# Work Tasks

Inter-agent task queue. Append new tasks to the bottom. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`.
The primary agent writes tasks here. The secondary agent picks them up, does the work in the repo, and marks them done.

## Format

```
- [ ] **Task title** — Description of what to do. Expected output. Files to touch.
  - Status: pending | in-progress | done
  - Output: (describe what was produced)
```
